 - Next create a new ItemDef, making sure it has these options.
  ```
  ```
|Option  | Value |
|--|--|
| style | WINDOW_STYLE_SHADER |
|background| (the name of your image)|
```
```

Setting the forecolor will effect the color of the image (the colour will appear differnt in-game)

**When you save your menu progress then re-upload the progress file, you will have to re-upload your images again.**

To use images in-game you will need to create a .iwi image and a material using asset manager.
